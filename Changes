	- AHICOX: baseName is auto-set based on the package name of the sourced file.
	          
			  NOTE: the '::' separator is removed so My::Great::Module gets the
			  automatic baseName of MyGreatModule.
			  
			  OTHER NOTE: should the user be able to override the auto-generated
			  base name with a POD directive like this?
			  =begin WSDL
			  _baseName OtherNameToUse
			  =cut
			  or perhaps at instatiation with a 'baseName' option?
